\section{Problems with throwing handlers}

One of my motivating cases for contracts~\cite{p0542} is being able to detect out of bounds
accesses in vector-like containers:

\begin{lstlisting}
class my_vector {
  //...
  double & operator[](int i) [[expects: i>=0 && i<size()]] { return buf[i]; }
  //...
};
\end{lstlisting}

A class designer may want to enrich this operator to state that it never throws:

\begin{lstlisting}
class my_vector {
  //...
  double & operator[](int i) noexcept [[expects: i>=0 && i<size()]] { return buf[i]; }
  //...
};
\end{lstlisting}

However, in this library type is used in an application that is built with a
violation handler that throws, the application will terminate as the exception
will happen in the context of a \cppkey{noexcept} function. The net effect is
that, with a throwing violation handler, there will be some contract violations
resulting in exceptions thrown while other contract violations would result in
program termination.

An answer to this paradox would be to ban \cppkey{expects} and \cppkey{ensures}
attributes from \cppkey{noexcept} functions. In explanation, you have make a
choice: either you make your function \cppkey{noexcept} but without any contract
at all, or you write the contract but give up trying to make the function
\cppkey{noexcept}.

However, having contracts in the form of \cppkey{expects} and \cppkey{ensures}
would allow the elimination of checks in those cases where they can be proved to
be unnecessary. The current situation would prevent standard library vendors
(and other library vendors) from deploying implementations with contract
conditions for noexcept functions as those functions could eventually be used in
a build with a throwing violation handler.

It might be worth to note that there are domains where, for different reasons,
exceptions are not used today. However, the current situation would impose them
not to use contracts in noexcept functions even if they will never have a
throwing violation handler. That seems a violation of the principle \emph{do not
pay for what you do not use}.
