\section{Introduction}

This paper proposes to require that a violation handler needs to be a
\cppkey{noexcept} function. That is, a violation handler cannot exit by throwing
an exception.

This change will allow that functions can be \cppkey{noexcept} and include a
contract in the form of \cppkey{expects} and \cppkey{ensures}.
